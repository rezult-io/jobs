# Frequently Asked Questions

## Where are your offices

We are based in México City, México.

## Do you have remote positions

For now, we don't. However, we do have a liberal work-from-home policy.

## What is a "liberal work-from-home policy"

At Rezult IO, we consider facetime super important, and so we want that people sit together as much as possible. At times you may need to stay home for personal reasons, or you may prefer to work from somewhere else. We are cool with that, as long as you are still available for planned meetings! Note that until the end of 2020 we expect to WFH by default due to the rise of covid-19 cases in order to keep our team safe.

## Do you accept international candidates

We do. Be aware that getting VISAs to come and work in Mexico may take a long time. But we like everyone!

## Where do I apply?

It's easy, send us an email to [careers@rezult.io](mailto:careers@rezult.io) with the subject of the job position and the body with the requiremewnts.
